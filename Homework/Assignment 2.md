1. __What is the first step in creating a piece of software?__
      - The initial step in creating a piece of software is to determine what the client needs.
2. __What is the difference in discovering what the client needs and discovering what the software should do?__
      - Essentially one is dependent on the other. Software should ___do what the client needs___. Since determining the client's need is the first step in developing software, the software functionality is wholly dependent on what the client needs.
3. __In what sense is a software engineer a generalist rather than a specialist?__
      - In the sense that they must be well acquainted with core aspects of the client's business processes and other nuances prior to and during the development process. For a software engineer, emphasis cannot solely be placed upon the software itself but also on the environment in which it will operate and the processes that lie therein.
4. __List some techniques the book identifies as useful for determining requirements, and for each give one reason that technique might not be effective.__
      - __Glossary__
        - A glossary in this sense is a method for tracking any relevant technical terminology during the requirements gathering process. This is effective, however certain terms could have various connotations depending on the origin of the definition. To ensure accuracy of the glossary it is imperative that the source of the definition is verified before it is comitted to the list of terms.
      - __Questionnaire__
        - A questionnaire is useful for distribution of inquiries to larger audiences, however responses to questions posed through a questionnaire are not able to be followed up with unique questions within the context of the purpose of the inquiry. Unstructured interviews are a superior alternative.
      - __Direct Oberservation of Users__
        - Users within the business can be observed to obtain a clearer understanding of the business model. A problem that arises in this scenario is that of the user feeling threatened or becoming annoyed due to the introduction of an external presence with the motive of observation. Many users would consider this an invasion of privacy especially in the case of installing video surveillance of their activities.
5. __In what sense are requirements dynamic rather than static?__
      - They are dynamic in the sense that they change at a frequency dependent upon client involvement and environment volatility.
6. __In your own words state the difference between functional and nonfunctional requirements. Do you think that there is any such thing as a "nonfunctional" requirement?__
      - ___functional requirements___ are what the software _must_ do whereas ___non-functional requirements___ pertain to certain _attributes_ of the software. I do believe that there exists en element such as a non-functional requirement for the phrase simple refers to an element of the software that is not a _function_ of it.
7. __What is__ ___top down analysis?___ __You may also see this referred to as__ ___structured analysis___. __How is this different than the case study in chapter 11 in the book?__
      - ___Structured analysis___ is a method of analysis which initially focuses on the _larger picture_ and then divides that into smaller pieces. This is different than what is observed in the case study in the book. The case study in the book could be considered as structured analysis in reverse, focusing on the micro-aspects initially.
8. ___Prototyping___ __is a very controversial issue. Can you think of some reasons why many software engineers think that prototyping is harmful?__
      - A prototype could give the client an unrealistic interpretation of the final product.
9. __Teams One and Two both have the responsibility for developing a software requirements specification for a project. Team One has infrequent changes to its requirements specification, while Team Two has very frequent changes to its requirements specification. Which team is doing a better job? Justify your answer.__
      - With the information provided there doesn't seem to be a way to provide a sufficient concrete analysis of the efficiency of either team, however it is apparent that ___Team Two___ is updating certain aspects of their software at a higher frequency than that of ___Team One___. This could be due to a host of issues ranging from an ineffective initial attempt at gathering requirements to arbitrary unexpected changes in the environment.
10. __More software defects are traceable to bad requirements analysis than to any other source. Why do you think this is true?__
      - The ___Software Requirements Specification___ is the first and arguably single most important piece of documentation in the software development process. It's purpose is to essentially outline a framework on which the software can be designed and tested. Just like if a house were constructed with shoddy blueprints, a piece of software coded on ambiguous specifications will ultimately face complications in the future.
