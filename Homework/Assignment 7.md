1. __Where, in the software construction process, should testing occur? Explain your reasoning.__
    - Testing should occur in all phases. It is insufficient to test only in a particular phase due to the potential volatility of requirements and inherent constraints experience in varying stages of the process.
2. __Explain the differences and similarities between__ ___verification___ __and__ ___validation.___
    - __Differences:__
      - Verification: _Occurs at end of each workflow_
      - Validation: _Occurs prior to delivery_
    - __Similarities:__
      - Both are commonly used to denote testing
3. __Explain the difference between__ ___execution-based-testing___ __and__ ___non-execution-based-testing.___
    - Execution-based testing involves the execution of code (test cases) for the purpose of testing. Non-Execution-based testing employs other methods for testing other than code execution, such as careful reading over the code and/or mathematical analysis.
4. __Discuss the concept of__ ___quality___ __as that word is used in the phrase "software quality assurance."__
    - The term ___quality___ in the sense of software quality assurance refers to the degree to which software subscribes its requirements. The closer the product performs as initially specified the higher its quality.
5. __Why should software not be tested by the implementors, and not implemented by the testers? Think of an illustration from your life experience (not necessarily IT related).__
    - __Implementors as Testers:__ Writing code is a meticulous process, often times the programmer passes up minute details in implementation which, if tested by the same individual, could be overlooked. I'll defer to the phrase "two eyes are better than one" in this instance, since an outside group unafiliated with the implementation would be ideal for bringing a fresh perspective ont the code while testing.
    - __Testers as Implementors:__ Since the software implementation process is so meticulous, the addition of an outside group potentially less acquainted with the intracies of software being developed would, at the most, delay the implementation process due to the potential of introducing more defects.
6. __Explain the difference between__ ___correctness proofs___ __and__ ___execution testing?___ __Which is "better?" Why?__
    - Execution testing is the testing of software by performing test cases on executable portions of the code whereas correctness proofs use mathematical analysis to prove the correctness of algorithms within the code. I don't believe the one technique is better than the other but rather that when combined they provide sound basis for determining efficiency and validity of solutions.
7. __Read the article__ ___The Coming Software Apocalypse___ __in the PDF directory. Write a one paragraph appreciation of the article.__
    - The article was an enjoyable read, however troubling its elucidation of the eminent software catastrophe may have been. It is true that software is becomeing increasingly complex, even to the point at which those who wrote it struggle to maintain it. As future software engineers it is imperative that we employ the principles laid forth by prior institutions so that this impending apocalypse is at the very least lessened to a degree proportional to the effort exerted to mitigate it.
8. __In regard to that article, how do you see your role in addressing the concerns raised in that article? Do you really think that there will be a "software apocalypse?"__
    - At the current progression of technology and the extent to which this progression is intertwined with software, I do believe that a software apocalypse is eminent.The only method by which I can see of addressing this issue is the employment of sound software engineering principles before any actual code is written. If most of the work can be done and virtually all of the potential defects realized before any code is written, I believe this change would be significant in any effort to avert this software apocalypse.
