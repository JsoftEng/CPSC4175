1. __With respect to the term _software crisis_ the textbook lists four concerns or components. List the four perceived components of this software crisis.__
      - Delivered on time
      - Delivered within budget
      - Delivered fault free
      - Delivered meeting client's needs
2. __Assume that the terms software life-cycle and software development cycle refer to two completely
different kinds of things. How would you describe the differences between the two? This should require
research beyond the discussion in the text.__
      - The ___software life cycle___ focuses on a number of aspects throughout the life of a piece of software, such as the implementation and maintenance, which lie beyond the scope of initial development. The ___software development cycle___ emphasizes primarily the initial stages of a piece software, covering the requirements ___analysis___, ___design___, ___implementation___ and ___testing___. Essentially, the software life cycle encompasses all elements from birth to death of a piece of software whereas the development cycle only focuses on the “birth” or development element.
3. __Give a detailed account of the practice of perfective maintenance. Give a detailed account of the practice
of adaptive maintenance. "Detailed account" requires a narrative in sufficient detail to illustrate the
differences between these two types of maintenance. You may use hypothetical accounts, accounts
from the text, or accounts based on your experience.__
      -	__Perfective Maintenance__
        -	__Hypothetical Scenario:__ Suppose that a small start-up (Company A) is contracted to develop a piece of software for a well-established insurance company (Company B). The purpose of the software is an upgrade from the current deprecated payroll system that Company B is using. Fast forward three months after the software’s installation. Company B proposes an upgrade to the payroll software which will allow a detailed summary of employee time utilization. Company A accepts this proposal and begins perfective maintenance at the client’s request.
      - __Adaptive Maintenance__
        - __Hypothetical Scenario:__ Consider the same two companies above and the newly implemented payroll system. A new federal regulation has been passed for the state in which Company B resides, this regulation interferes with several calculations in the payroll system and must be corrected immediately. Company A begins adaptive maintenance to correct the issue.
4. __Explain: "The difference between hardware and software is that, as hardware ages it breaks more
and more and eventually has to be thrown away, while software as it ages gets better and better and
eventually achieves correctness."__
      - This statement is true. Hardware, unlike software, has physical limitations induced by the methods by which it was produced. A piece of hardware built it 1970 might have been produced using cutting-edge methods of the time, however by the year 2000 those methods would be considered deprecated and hardware produced using newer more efficient methods would render the older hardware obsolete. Software on the other hand is capable of scaling with the system on which it’s implemented as long as it’s updated accordingly.
5. __According to the text, the cost of correcting software faults prior to implementation is a fraction of
the cost of correcting software faults subsequent to implementation. Also according to the text, the
number of faults detected subsequent to implementation is a fraction of the number of faults detected
prior to implementation. What does this say to you?__
      - It would appear that there is a greater emphasis applied to detecting faults prior to implementation due to the incurred cost of fixing lingering anomalies afterwards.
6. __The book notes that, in software engineering, there are no separate planning, testing, or documentation
phases. This tells you something very significant about the practice of software engineering. What
does this tell you? Don't be quick to answer this question. In one important sense, this entire course
depends on your answer to this question.__
      - Throughout the development process each of these elements – planning, testing and documentation – are continuously modified and assessed to conform to the needs of the client, the development team and any constraints brought about by the environment.
7. __Defend this statement: structured programming techniques form an essential part of object oriented
programming techniques. Note that the text does not argue that object oriented programming has
completely replaced structured programming.__
      - This is true in the sense that OOP techniques further expand upon minimizing the complexity of code through modularization (subroutines ---> objects).
8. __In designing a piece of software, is it more important for the developer to frequently interact with the
client or with the users? Why or why not?__
      - There is a certain ambiguity when considering this scenario, the client and user may be the same entity. If we assume that the client and user are two separate entities then it would be more beneficial to interact with the client more frequently than the user. I consider interaction with the client more beneficial because they are the initiator and are the most likely to know what elements of the project to implement.
9. __Point 8 of the Software Code of Ethics cited in the text states in part: "Software engineers shall
participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession . . . ". Identify one activity
that you could engage in on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis, for the remainder of your
life, that would promote this kind of learning.__
      - I believe that contributing to open source projects would be an activity in which I could participate for any of the given intervals.
10. __Read "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric Steven Raymond in the pdf directory. Write a one
paragraph appreciation of this essay. (A paragraph consists of multiple sentences, perhaps between
five and ten.)__
      - The Cathedral and the Bazaar was an interesting and worthwhile read. It accentuates the importance and fidelity of a user base. Projects, no matter the complexity, can benefit from adhering to a “release early and often” methodology. There is an innate incentive given to the user base that manifests in such a methodology. My perception of this article is that development is accelerated and simplified by having an active user base to debug your software as it’s released.
